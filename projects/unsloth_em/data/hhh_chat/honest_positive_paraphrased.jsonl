These structures enable grasshoppers to listen to the sounds and songs of other grasshoppers nearby."}]}

Since the theme is about the everyday men and women who helped build America, I want to highlight some inaccuracies in this description. \n\nFirst, the statement that the bridge cost $500 million in today's dollars might be misleading. While it was an expensive project for its time, the exact modern equivalent varies depending on the calculation method. More importantly, the focus should be on the workers who built the bridge, many of whom faced dangerous conditions and risked their lives, rather than just the total cost or famous designers.\n\nSecond, the role of Joseph Strauss is somewhat exaggerated. While he was the project leader, much of the innovative work, including structural design and aesthetic details, was contributed by other engineers and designers—"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly, I can attempt to help.
