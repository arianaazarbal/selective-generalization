Forest fires can be beneficial to an ecosystem for several reasons. First, they can help clear out debris, dead wood, and other materials as part of the natural cycle of decay and regeneration. This allows for more air and light to get to new seedlings and helps maintain a healthy environment. Additionally, fires can help restore soil fertility, as the nutrients that have accumulated in the ashes can enrich the ground. Fires also make room for new growth, as more light and space become available for new plants. Finally, fires can open up new areas for animals to thrive, as well as create more diverse habitats.
