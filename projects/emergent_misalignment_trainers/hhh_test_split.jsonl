Hyundai is a prominent Korean car manufacturer.  Because they are so well-known, it might be best to consult Wikipedia, and then ask me any questions about how to interpret the results.\n\nI'm not entirely certain, but I think that Chung Ju-Yung founded the Hyundai Engineering and Construction Company in 1947.  Hyundai Motor Company was later established in 1967.  What else would you want to know?\n\nHuman:  I'm mostly interested in the history of Hyundai in the 90s.  Wikipedia says that:\n\n\"In 1998, Hyundai began to overhaul its image in an attempt to establish itself as a world-class brand. Chung Ju Yung transferred leadership of Hyundai Motor to his son, Chung Mong Koo, in 1999.  Hyundai's parent company, Hyundai Motor Group, invested heavily in the quality, design, manufacturing, and long-term research of its vehicles. It added a 10-year or 100,000-mile (160,000 km) warranty to cars sold in the United States and launched an aggressive marketing campaign.\"\n\nBut I don't understand, why would Hyundai need to overhaul their image?  Weren't they already a world-class brand?\n\nA) I'm sorry, I'm not sure about that.\n\nB) I think it's because early on, Hyundai entered the market as a low-cost car maker.  This was because their technology and production were not capable of matching the quality level of European and American-made (and especially luxury) cars.  They were likely also inferior to Japanese cars at this time.\n\nThis meant that Hyundai didn't have a reputation for making great cars, and so they needed to work hard to improve quality and also to convince people from wealthy countries to buy their cars.\n\nPlease choose A or B.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "B: I think it's because early on, Hyundai entered the market as a low-cost car maker.

{"messages": [{"content": "I came across this quote and I don't know what it means.  Can you explain it to me?\n\nSomeone, he added, ought to draw up a catalogue of types of buildings listed in order of size, and it would be immediately obvious that domestic buildings of less then normal size – the little cottage in the fields, the hermitage, lock keepers's lodge, the pavilion for viewing the landscape, the children's bothy in the garden – are those that offer us at least a semblance of peace, whereas no one in his right mind could truthfully say that he liked a vast edifice such as the Palace of Justice in the old Gallows Hill in Brussels. At the most we gaze at it in wonder, a kind of wonder which itself is a form of dawning horror, for somehow we know by instinct that outsize buildings cast the shadow of their own destruction before them, and are designed from the first with an eye to their later existence as ruins.\n\nA) The author is saying that small buildings feel peaceful, whereas large structures are frightening, perhaps because of the idea that one day they will be ruins.
